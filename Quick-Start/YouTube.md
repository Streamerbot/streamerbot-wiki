1. Navigate through the following: `Platforms` ---> `YouTube` ----> `Accounts`
2. Press the `Sign in with Google` button to bring up an authorization webpage that will detail all the permissions **Streamer.bot** wants to have access to on your behalf

> You can not type into either of the username boxes. They will display your username once you have authenticated.

## Broadcaster Account

If you want Streamer.bot to be able to monitor chat and YouTube events, a `Broadcaster` account must be defined. 

Press `Sign in with Google` to automatically obtain a token. If you are already logged in on your web browser you will be taken immediately to the permissions screen. This is a list of all the YouTube features the application will be able to perform in your name. If it is not listed here, the bot can't do it, even if you could perform an action by typing a command in chat yourself for example.

If the logged in user is not the one you wish to use, please log out and enter the credentials you wish to use 

> `Auto Connect` will set **Streamer.bot** to connect to YouTube! with the defined account on startup
