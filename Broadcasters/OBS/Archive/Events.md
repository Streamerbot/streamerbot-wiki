This is a full reference of all [OBS WebSocket](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket/blob/4.x-current/docs/generated/protocol.md) events that can be mapped to [actions](/en/Actions) in Streamer.bot.

Some events, such as `SwitchScenes` & `ScenesChanged`, may act as pre & post events.
It is important to consider your use case when deciding which event is best suited for you.
