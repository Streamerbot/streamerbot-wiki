# Overview
Control your Streamlabs Desktop instance(s) with Streamer.bot

Adding at least one connection will allow you to control your Streamlabs Desktop either through the various [sub-actions](/Sub-Actions) that have been included, or via the [Execute C# Code](/Sub-Actions/Code/Execute-CSharp-Code) sub-action

# Configuration
`Right-Click` `->` `Add` to define a new connection
Give it a name and set the IP address and Port number of your SLOBS / Streamlabs Desktop installation

The Default values of `127.0.0.1` and `59650` will look for the out-of-box configuration for SLOBS / Streamlabs Desktop installed on the same computer as Streamer.bot is running

`Token` is required and can be obtained through the settings page for SLOBS / Streamlabs Desktop
