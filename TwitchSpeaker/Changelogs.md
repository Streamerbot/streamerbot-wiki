## IMPORTANT
I've altered the way the files are, so I would ## highly recommend extracing to a new folder and copying your settings over. (settings.json, voicealiases.dat, users.dat, usage.dat)

## IMPORTANT

## Some updates to Pitch/Rate/Emphasis

## Amazon Poly
Rate can now be adjusted from `-20` to `20`, this equates to a 5% change in rate from baseline, pitch can now be adjusted from `-9` to `11`, this is a 5% relative change from baseline. Pitch is ## NOT supported on Neural voices Emphasis is supported on Standard voices only.

## Google Voice
Rate can now be adjusted from `-20` to `20`, this equates to a 5% change in rate from baseline; Pitch can now be adjusted from `-19` to `21`, this is a 5% relative change from baseline. Emphasis is supported on Standard and WaveNet voices.

## IBM Watson
Rate can now be adjusted from `-20` to `20`, this equates to a 5% change in rate from baseline; Pitch can now be adjusted from `-19` to `21`, this is a 5% relative change from baseline. Emphasis is ## NOT supported on any voices.

## NOTE In testing, I found the Watson voices to behave a bit strange when going to the extremes

## Microsoft Azure
Rate can now be adjusted from `-10` to `10`, this equates to a 5% change in rate from baseline; Pitch can now be adjusted from `-9` to `11`, this is a 5% relative change from baseline. Emphasis is supported on Standard and Neural voices (might be hit or miss on neural voices).

{.changelog-new}

## Ignored Voice Profiles
You can now setup profiles for ignored voices/locales.

This adds a new moderator command !tts profile, !tts profile list, !tts profile activate

## Regex Replacement
I know a lot have wanted this feature, and I've been very reluctant on adding it. Flat out, if I get wind of it being used in a purposefully hateful/hurtful way, I will pull all zips that have this version, and remove the code for it.

This replacement will occur for ## all spoken text (message, events, etc), in the chain of events, this is the last thing processed.

An example replacement: Replace: `[_\-!@#$%^&*()]*,` With: a space, this will replace 1 or more, of any of the characters with a space, so a username that has _ in it, will get spaces instead. Replace: `\d{3,}`, With nothing, this will remove all occurances of 3 or more numbers

Order of replacements is also something to keep in mind
