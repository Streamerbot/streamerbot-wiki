Starting with the left side of this window is the list of users/viewer that are currently in chat. this will be populated as you stream but if you are offline and want to alter a viewer’s options that is not currently present in chat, but the TwitchSpeaker has seen in your chat before then uncheck the box named `Hide Not Present` this pane will now be populated with all the users TwitchSpeaker has seen in your Twitch chat. from this pane select a user/viewer you which to alter the options to once you have done this is the users information pane in the middle will be filled in with users’ data.

So, as you can see from the screen capture above you have a text field a few check boxes and a dropdown menu as well as some fields you cannot edit but can see the data associated to that specific user but I’ll explain each. 

- ID - this field you cannot alter but it displays each User/Viewer Unique ID to Twitch
- Username - This field displays the User/Viewers Username they have set on the Twitch Account.
- Role - This field displays the role on your channel (I.E Moderator, VIP, Broadcaster, Viewer)
- Voice Alias - This drop-down box allows to assign a custom Voice alias to the user which will be explained in its own section.
- Nickname - This field is where you would give/amend a user’s nickname 
- Last Active - This field display's when the user was last active in your Twitch chat
- The 4 check boxes -
	1. **Ignored** - Check this box on the user and Twitch Speaker will not say anything that user input to the Twitch Chat
	1. **Forced** - This check box will make Twitch Speaker say everything that user inputs to Twitch 	chat.
	1. **Regular** - check this to enable a user to use TwitchSpeaker. This only is effective if the `Say Everything` setting is checked in the permissions under the `Settings` tab.
	1. **Subscribed** - Check this to enable a user to use TwitchSpeaker if they are subscribed. This only is effective if the `Say Everything` setting is unchecked in the permissions under the `Settings` tab.
      
The last pane is called `Past Voices` in this tab will display all the voices one user has been assigned or has used. The time stamp and the name of the voice(s) used will appear in this pane.
