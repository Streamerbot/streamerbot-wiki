## Auto Updater
With version 0.1.14, the ground work has been put in to include an auto updater, which means, this is the **last** version that will require you to manually update.  Moving forward, starting with version 0.1.15, you will be able to update within **Streamer.bot** itself.

If you have been using the recent betas, or are part of alpha testing, you've already been giving this feature a try!

When you launch **Streamer.bot** it will perform a check to see if there is an update, and if there is, you will see a screen pop-up similar to the one below.

![auto-updater-001.png](/update/auto-updater-001.png)

After you click `Download`, and the update is downloaded, you will be able to install the update by clicking on `Install`

![auto-updater-002.png](/update/auto-updater-002.png)

As you can see, there are update channels, `stable`, `beta`, `alpha`.  By default everyone will be on the stable channel, which are the public releases.

To be able to select any other update channel, you will need to have **Streamer.bot** connected to the website, under Integrations, and have the appropriate roles in the Discord.

## New Twitch Broadcaster Scopes
* `channel:read:charity`
* `moderator:manage:chat_messages`
* `moderator:read:chatters`
{.grid-list}

## New Twitch Bot Scopes
* `moderator:manage:chat_messages`
{.grid-list}

## Twitch Present Viewer Tick
I have gone through and changed how the present viewer tick operates, it is still possible to have the same behavior as 0.1.12, so continue reading.

The present viewer tick will always happen, but you now have the ability to have it "live update" from twitch, or artificially mark someone as present.

Under the Present Viewer action selector, there are 2 new setttings, a `Live Update` check box, and a slider bar.

When Live Update is checked, the slider next to it is how often this update will occur, between 1 and 10 minutes, this will also still execute the action at this interval.

When Live Update is not checked, the slider next to it behaves as a threshold. The timer runs every minute, and checks the current time minus the user's last active time, if this is less then the threshold, they are marked as present, otherwise they are marked as not present.  The action will still be executed, but, it will occur every minute.

The default setting is `Live Update` not checked, and the slider set to `5` minutes.  To have the same functionality as 0.1.12 and earlier, enable `Live Update` and make sure the slider is set to `5` minutes.

## Twitch Charity
The newly released Charity feature of Twitch is now supported within **Streamer.bot**

This introduces 2 new events, **Donation** and **Completed**

## Twitch Timeout and Ban Events
Switching these events to use the data that comes from PubSub, they may happen quicker, as well, more variables are available.

Both the ban and timeout events gain the following variables

Name | Description
----:|:------------
`createdAt` | The date and time the ban or timeout was created
`createdById` | The Twitch ID of the user who created the ban or timeout
`createdByUsername` | The user name of the user who created the ban or timeout
`createdByDisplayName` | The display name of the user who created the ban or timeout
`reason` | The reason for the ban or timeout

### Donation Event
The donation event occurs when someone has donated to your charity.

Variable that are included are as follows:

Name | Description

`baseAmount` | The amount of the donation as a whole number
`donationAmount` | The amount of the donation in decimal form
`charity.name` | The name of the charity you are supporting
`currency.code` | The 3 letter ISO currency code
`currency.exponent` | Divide base amount by 10 to the power of this number to get the decimal value
{.vars-table}

> Twitch is providing amount values for Charity calls as whole numbers, so $42.00 will return as 4200.
{.is-warning}

### Completed Event
When donations come through, a check is made if your current donation amount matches what your goal is, and will send a completed event if this is true.

Variable that are included are as follows:

Name | Description
----:|:------------
`charity.id` | Twitch's internal ID for your campaign
`charity.timestamp` | The timestamp of the event
`charity.currency` | The 3 letter ISO currency code

{.is-warning}

## Twitch Shoutout
Twitch recently added, as a beta feature a new `/shoutout` command, so for those users who have this on there channel, you can now react to when you, or a moderator uses this command, and treat it like a !so chat command!

The user who was given the shoutout will be contained in the `target*` variables.

Available variables:

Name | Description
----:|:------------
`shoutoutId` | Twitch's internal ID for the shoutout
`targetUserId` | The user's id
`targetUserLogin` | The user's login name

## Shopify
By using the **Streamer.bot** website, you can now add webhooks to your Shopify store front!

> Supported webhook events include `Order creation` and `Order payment`
{.is-warning}

There are 2 new events within **Streamer.bot** that you can associate an action with, `Order Created`and `Order Paid`.  Both of these events will provide you with almost all the information that is provided by the webhook.

The best way to check the variables, is to setup your webhooks, and assign an empty action, then check the available variables in the `Action History` tab under `Action Queues`

## New Sub-actions
### OBS Set Color Source Color

Added a new sub-action that lets you set the color of a color source within OBS.  All fields support `%variable%` replacement, and there is an option to just set a random color.

## Twitch Whisper
Some important notes with how Twitch Whispers appear to be handled now, this is a copy from the Twitch development documentation.

The user sending the whisper must have a **verified phone number** (see the **Phone Number setting** in your **Security and Privacy settings**).

The API may silently drop whispers that it suspects of violating Twitch policies, it will still indicate success even if the message is dropped.

Rate Limits: You may whisper to a maximum of **40 unique recipients per day**. Within the per day limit, you may whisper a maximum of 3 whispers per second and a maximum of 100 whispers per minute.

The maximum message lengths are:
* 500 characters if the user you're sending the message to hasn't whispered you before.
* 10,000 characters if the user you're sending the message to has whispered you before.

Messages that exceed the maximum length are truncated.
