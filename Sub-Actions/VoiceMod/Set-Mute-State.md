With the Streamer.bot (0.18 +) you can set the Mute State that is included with the VoiceMod Application.

First make sure Streamer.bot is connected to VoiceMod (if you haven't done this and /or don't know how please check out the how to connect to VoiceMod [here.](/en/Integrations/VoiceMod))
Once you have done this you can now proceed to the set up this Sub-Action.


To do this navigate to the Actions tab, next you can either create a new action or use an existing one.
Next in the Sub-Action's pane you will need to add this sub action so to do this we `Right Click` in the Sub-Action pane next navigate the menus through the following `Add Sub-Action` the down the second menu to `VoiceMod` the click on the `Set Mute State` action.
