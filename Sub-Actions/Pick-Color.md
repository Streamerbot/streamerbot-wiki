## Configuration
### Color / OBS Color
The Color picker will give the standard pallet picker so you can chose by a slider or by entering raw RGB / HSL values

Once a color is chosen the `Color` box will be populated with the RGB Hex value and `OBS Color` will populate with the raw integer value OBS expects for ABGR it uses for its natively supported sources.

### Variable Name
Enter an alias for the resulting variables, outlined below. Don't use %'s in this field this will be done automatically.

## Variables
The following variables will be available after execution of this sub-action:

> In each of the following variables, replace `variableName` with the variable name you configured.
