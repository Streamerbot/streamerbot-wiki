## Overview
Using this sub-action, you can load the entire contents of a file into your action, then you can have the bot read a random line from the file and load it into a variable `%randomLine%`.

## Configuration
### Parse Variables
If this option is selected, when reading in the lines, if there are any %variables% present, they will be replaced with the current contents of the specified variable. 
Example:

You have a file containing a list of welcome messages, such as: 
Welcome `%user%`.
Greetings `%user%`.
Nice to see you `%user%`, have a seat.

The `%user%` would be replaced when reading the file.

### Attempt Auto-typing
While reading the contents of the file, an attempt will be made on each line to determine its ‘type’. So, if it's a number, it will make sure the variable is defined as a numeric, if it contains a string it will define the variable as a string. This is useful for future operations on the created variable.

### Count
This option defines the number of lines that will be read from the file.
